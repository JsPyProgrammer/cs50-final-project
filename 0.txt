The object of the game is simple. Try to get the green ball past the computer's paddle five times. After you have done it five times, you win the game.

This might sound simple at first, but don't get your pride up too much. The computer has three different skill levels, easy, medium, and hard. You can't call yourself a PyPong champion until you beat the computer in all three levels.
